# Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion Calculator
https://ricevillage.github.io/routh-array/

This is a web application that calculates the stability of a given polynomial using the Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion. The application is written in JavaScript and can be run directly in a web browser.


## How to Use
1. Enter the coefficients of the polynomial in the input fields. The polynomial should be in descending order of degree, and missing coefficients should be represented as zero.
2. Click the "Solve" button.
3. The resulting Routh-Hurwitz table and stability of the system will be displayed below the input fields.
